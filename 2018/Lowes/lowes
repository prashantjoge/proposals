Installation Services
  
Current State
    
1. On the web, customer requests the service via the web
    
2. Lowes receives customer information and contacts them
    
3. On the floor, Customer requests reccomendation for installation services
    
4. Lowes does not have an acredited list of contractors

  

Disadvantages
    
1. Customer leaves the Lowes portal, looks for similar services in competitors websites (eg. home depot, angies list, Amazon)
    
2. Competition offers serv:ices that are on demand and satisfies the customers immediate need 
    
3. Lowes incurs loss from missed commisions, upselling and cross selling oppurtunities

1. 


Disconnected customers
Lost customer Loyalty
Missed Oppurtunites

Desired outcome   
1. Build rock solid base of prosumers
    
2. Attract customers in the first instance
    
3. Increase prospects
