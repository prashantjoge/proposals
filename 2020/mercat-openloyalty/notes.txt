Customer Loyalty is the inclination for an individual to favour a particular product, brand or service.  Getting people loyal to a brand was fairly straightforward - create a great product, market it well and offer stellar customer support. However, the digital explosion has made it harder than ever before for brands to engage and retain a loyal customer base. Today, a customer is bombarded with hundreds of communications from multiple brands with few differentiators.

Gaining customer loyalty cannot be a one-off thing. A brand needs a focused and integrated plan to retain its best customers - put simply, it needs a customer loyalty program. A loyalty program typically involves giving customers free merchandise, early access to sales, products and coupons. Loyalty programs have been proven to be extremely successful in driving repeat sales for brands. The "Get With The Program" report states that all other things being equal, 72% of consumers will buy from retailer with a loyalty program over one without.

Benefits Of Customer Loyalty Programs
The primary objective of a loyalty program is to retain existing customers and encourage repeat purchases. An Accenture Report found that 66% of US consumers spent more on brands that they were emotionally connected or loyal to.

Metrics used in our Loyalty Program
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is simply the overall revenue contribution you can expect from a customer during his/her engagement with your brand. To calculate CLV, you need to first calculate the Customer Value
diag3 and diag 4

Redemption Rate
diag 5
Redemption Rate is a percentage which indicates at what rate are your customers are redeeming their loyalty points. A high redemption rate indicates that your customers are highly engaged with your loyalty program. A healthy benchmark is a 25% redemption rate; anything less than that and it indicates an issue with the redemption process of your loyalty program, i.e., your customers are earning loyalty points and are not spending them. Here's how you calculate the redemption rate of your loyalty program.

Active Engagement Rate
diag 6
This ties in with Redemption Rate in that it measures the number of customers who are actively engaged with your loyalty program (through points earned and redeemed).

Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR)
diag7
While CLV is a great way to measure the long term impact of your loyalty program, the Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR) gives you an overview of the short-midterm impact. The Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR) basically gives you the percentage of customers who have made more than one purchase for a period of 1 year. One of the primary objective of a loyalty program is to increase repeat purchases and thus measuring the RPR is critical for gauging the effectiveness of a reward program. Also, remember that the RPR has a major impact in increasing the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
