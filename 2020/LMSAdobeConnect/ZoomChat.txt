Shawn Q.
hi there

How exactly are you planning on using Zoom?
prashant thomas
We would like to integrate zoom into our mobile and web applications to provide a seamless experience to our clients. means no additional downloads

is it possible?

The api page says that this is possible

hello


Shawn Q.
sorry for the delay

yes it is possible

The API plan will allow you to:?  Quickly and easily enable video meetings on your website.?  One click to start or join meetings.?  Create a custom personal, room or meeting ID.  ?Instantly create a number of hosts.?  Generate reports on all users.  ??The monthly prepay plan starts at $100 and includes 4,000 meeting minutes per month. However, if you commit to $500 per month, you will be subscribed at a lower rate.
prashant thomas
will the api plan allow me to integrate zoom into our mobile apps

can u be more specific about the $500 plan

we are looking to hold 0ne is to one plans


Shawn Q.
let me pull in support to try and answer
prashant thomas
great.... thanks

We are a services company and would like to use Zoom as part of our solution proposal

for a large client in the middle east

Seamless integration with Mobile and desktop is crucial. We were looking at Adobe connect.. but it doesnt seem to meet all of the requirements

I understand the bandwidth requirements are about 1.4 MB for a one on one session.  Is this true? also does this cascade across for multiples... for ex 2.8 MB for 2 one-on-one sessions


Shawn Q.
those are outlined in this document

im not sure as I'm on the sales team not technical

hello prashant

Shawn Q.
Prashant's question was around using API to integrate into their mobile app i believe
prashant thomas
hi


Mahin
thanks shawn
prashant thomas
thats true Shawn


Mahin
is this your question prashant?

I understand the bandwidth requirements are about 1.4 MB for a one on one session. Is this true? also does this cascade across for multiples... for ex 2.8 MB for 2 one-on-one sessions
prashant thomas
yes... that was one of the questions. is this true?


Mahin
Recommended bandwidth for Meetings:
For 1:1 video calling: 600kbps (up/down) for HQ video and 1.2 Mbps (up/down) for HD video
For group video calling: 600kbps/1.2Mbps (up/down) for HQ video. For gallery view: 1.5Mbps/1.5Mbps (up/down).
prashant thomas
Mahin my question is , does this pan out to multiple users... say for example 1.2 MBPS for 2 users using HQ video and audio


Mahin
this applies to every user if that helps.
prashant thomas
I was looking for a more authoritative answer than what the blurb says on the site. I read that and I understood what it says... My next question was around integration  with mobile apps. Is it seamless? means if the client installs our custom app.. would they have a seamless experience..or would they still be redirected to the zoom site or prompted to download another app

sorry, if am being blunt, I just need to make sure about the facts before I throw this over to the client and make a solution proposal


Mahin
I do understand but zoom works on dynamic bandwidth, so this are the recomended bandwidth.

Mahin
since you are customizing using our api to create the app, no further app is needed from zoom end.
prashant thomas
any ideas on the customization effort for a seasoned developer.. say from a scale of 1-10


Mahin
im not from a developer end but as i know it should be pretty straight forward as we have provided most details that required to create using API's .
prashant thomas
one last question, can u give me more details about the pricing specificall the $500 /month

this is using API


Mahin
shawn could you help on this?

Mahin
hang on prashant, im getting sales to help you on that question.
prashant thomas
tx


Shawn Q.
what i can do is get you connected to an account executive to discuss that

i can introduce you via email

In order to get you to your personal point of contact, could you provide the following information: Company, HQ location, contact name, phone number, and email address?
prashant thomas
if u could just ping someone to get quick answer

Verbat technologies

Shawn Q.
i just did, awaiting reply
prashant thomas
Prashant Thomas


Shawn Q.
would you like to formally engage with our sales team though? Sounds liek there is a legitimate project and need

what's the timeline for this project?
prashant thomas
we are looking at a 4 month development time line...

Zoom would be the only external integration, but very crucial, since its a one on one tuition application for teachers and students


Shawn Q.
ok
prashant thomas
we are thinking 200-300 hours at a minimum per mmonth


Shawn Q.
so you'd get at least 20,000 meeting minutes at least but very likely that will be increased and we can negotiate

would you like for me to make that email intro?
prashant thomas
sure


Shawn Q.
ok will do

whats the best number for you?
prashant thomas
8086517455

If this person could be slightly technical as well, that would be great


Shawn Q.
sure thing, we can work that out get your questions addressed, no problem

prashant thomas
are u still there? I had one more technical question


Shawn Q.
i can try answering
prashant thomas
If I Schedule a meeting for 2 people using the API, How will they join the meeting since they neither of them are the host. My application will be scheduling the meeting for a later time so that 2 people can meet

in real life situations the the host will start the meeting so that the others can join.,. How does this work when using the API


Shawn Q.
let me ask support
prashant thomas

Edmond
Hi there
prashant thomas
can u see my question


Edmond
So when you create and schedule the meeting you will need to have a host
prashant thomas
the host will be the application rt? If I am using API services


Edmond
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363053-REST-Meeting-API
prashant thomas
it doesnt have join meeting


Edmond
to join a meeting the participants need the link. you can select join before host

this will allow the participants to join with out the host

but there will not be any host controls
prashant thomas
so the host is not needed to join the meeting?

oh k...

I am talking from an embedded application point of view

so if I am on a mobile device, I would need the chat within my app... this will work rt?

or vdo conferencing


Edmond
to join the meeting on the phone you will need the join via the app

Sorry we did not hear back from you. Please contact us at https://support.zoom.us again! Goodbye.
